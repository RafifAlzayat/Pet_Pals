# Confusion Matrix Interpretation

In this activity, you'll create a logistic regression model to predict the onset of diabetes in five years for the 1988 Pima Diabetes dataset and interpret the confusion matrix that the model produces.

[Using the ADAP Learning Algorithm to Forecast the Onset of Diabetes Mellitus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2245318/) J.W. Smith, J.E. Everhart, W.C. Dickson, W.C. Knowler, and R.S. Johannes, Proc Annu Symp Comput Appl Med Care. 1988 Nov 9 : 261–265.

## Instructions

1. Load the Pima Diabetes dataset, and then split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Fit a logistic regression model to the training set.

3. Create a confusion matrix of the predicted vs. the actual outcomes for the testing set.

4. Manually calculate the precision, sensitivity, and F1 score of the model by using the values from the confusion matrix.

5. Create the classification report, and compare it to your manually calculated scores.

6. Answer the following questions: Is your model more precise or more sensitive? Which is more important for this model?

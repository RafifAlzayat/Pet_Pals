# Instructions

When it comes to creating a hypothesis, you must first start by proposing a question. These questions will often come from looking at data you have summarized or visualized. For this activity, you and a partner will look at some example questions we may ask in a scientific study, or for an analysis in an industry job. Creating hypotheses is a critical skill in order to properly identify what statistical analysis to use when analyzing data.

1. Based on the following scientific questions, work with your partner to create a hypothesis statement:

   * Does dark chocolate affect arterial (heart and circulatory system) function in healthy individuals?

   * Does coffee have anti-aging properties?

   * Is biodiesel better for the environment than fossil fuel?

2. For each hypothesis statement, propose a null and alternative hypothesis.

**Note:** Be prepared to discuss your answers when you return to the class.

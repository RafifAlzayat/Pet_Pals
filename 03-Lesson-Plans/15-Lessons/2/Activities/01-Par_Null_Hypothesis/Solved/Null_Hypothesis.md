# Null Hypothesis

* Does dark chocolate positively affect arterial function in healthy individuals? 

  * Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate per day for 1 year will result in improved arterial function.

  * Null Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is not related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g per day of dark chocolate for 1 year will show no improvement in arterial function.

  * Alternative Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate per day for 1 year will show improvement in arterial function.

* Does coffee have anti-aging properties?

  * Hypothesis - If coffee consumption is related to anti-aging, then consuming 400mg of coffee daily will reduce mortality from age-related disease such as heart disease.

  * Null Hypothesis - If coffee consumption is not related to anti-aging, then consuming 400mg of coffee daily will not show a reduction in age-related disease such as heart disease.

  * Alternative Hypothesis - If coffee consumption is related to anti-aging, then consuming 400mg of coffee daily will show a reduction in age-related disease such as heart disease.

* Is biodesel better for the environment than fossil fuel?

  * Hypothesis - If we assume that carbon emission is the largest contributing factor to environmental damage from burning fuel, then biodiesel should produce significantly less carbon than fossil fuel.

  * Null Hypothesis - If we burn one gallon of both fuels, fossil fuel will produce the same or less carbon than biodiesel.

  * Alternative Hypothesis - If we burn one gallon of both fuels, fossil fuel will produce more carbon than biodiesel.

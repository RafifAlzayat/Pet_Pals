# Bag and Boost

In this activity, you'll apply three aggregate classifiers to predict diabetes for the Pima Diabetes dataset.

## Instructions

1. Import a Random Forests classifier and then fit the model to the data.

2. Import an Extremely Random Trees classifier and then fit the model to the data.

3. Import an Adaptive Boosting classifier and then fit the model to the data.

4. Calculate the classification report for each model. Also, calculate the score for both the training and the testing set. Compare the performance of the three models.

## Bonus

1. Refactor to reduce repetitive code. Create a function that takes in a model and a dataset and prints a classification report to compare different models.

2. Choose one of the models, and then read the scikit-learn documentation. Use your newly created function to try different parameters. Can you improve the model?

### 2. Group Project Check

| Activity Time:       0:15 |  Elapsed Time:      0:20  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>ðŸŽ‰  2.1 Everyone Do: Group Check-In (0:05)</strong></summary>

* You can use slide 9 to begin the poll. 

* Open the [Zoom Polling](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-Meetings) feature or a [Poll Everywhere](http://www.polleverywhere.com), then launch a poll of the class to identify areas that students would like to review from this project week.

* Poll Text:
* How are you feeling about the current state of your project?

  * It's ready for the next stage!
  * I'm a little stressed, but the project will be ready for the next stage in time.
  * One or two members are behind. I'm a little worried.
  * We are all behind on our parts. I'm really worried. Help!

* Use the results to gauge how the groups are feeling and keep the results in mind during check-ins.

    <summary><strong> ðŸ“£ 2.2 Instructor Do: Slide Show (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G1xm-_3oQjczvEYKkWn4CQ9w3uIGFWbaQVvRMpT5Snw/edit?usp=sharing) 10 - 13, point out the following: 

  * Using **slide 10**, explain that by this point, students should have the steps on this slide completed; if they do not, they need to get up to speed as soon as possible, or theyâ€™ll risk following too far behind schedule.

  * Using **slide 11**, remind the students that they may need to help other team members to prevent the project from falling behind schedule. Be sure to reiterate that communication among team members is vital to the completion of the project.

  * Using **slide 12**, explain that today is for project work, but it is also a good chance to get assistance if they are having issues. The instructional team will also check in with the groups to  have them show their progress up to this point.

  * Using **slide 13**, explain that when a member of the instructional staff approaches the group, they should be ready to discuss or show the progress they have made up to this point. This should be in the form of code (on GitHub), Google slides, or a storyboard that they would show to a shareholder. The groups should be prepared to discuss their machine learning model, their database and its relationships, their dashboard, and where they should be next week.

<details>
    <summary><strong> ðŸ“£ 2.3 Instructor Do: Compare to Rubric (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Use slide 14 to point out the categories that will be graded for this section as shown in Canvas. 

* One way to help teams stay on track is to compare their work progress to the second segment's rubric. Understanding how close they are to each deliverable will tell you a few things.

* First, if they aren't meeting any milestones, it could be an indicator that they're lost or stuck. Alternatively, it could also mean that they aren't very efficient with their time. This is a great opportunity to help realign strategies and goals as needed.

* Click [here](Resources/Segment_2_rubric.pdf) to view the rubric for the second segment.

<details>
    <summary><strong> ðŸ“£ 3.1 Instructor Do: Conduct Check-ins (1:35)</strong></summary>

* This week, you will be checking in on the progress teams have made so far. The teams should be in full flight on their projects, and they should be preparing for their deliverables. Be prepared for various challenges or roadblocks that each member may have.

* Create breakout rooms for each team, have them continue working on their project, and have them get ready to deliver their content for this segment. Make sure they are ready to address any problems they are having. If a team is not currently checking in with you, they should be focusing on their project goals for this segment.

* **Note**: The following times are only recommendations for each team's check-in (a total of 15 minutes per team). Based on the size of your cohort, you may need to adjust the timing so every group gets some assistance.

* Begin the check-in by encouraging the team to talk you through the progress they have made up to this point. They should have a draft of a presentation ready. As they are presenting, consider the following questions:

* Does the GitHub repo have a README.md with a description?
  * Does each team member have a branch, and has each branch been used?
  * Is there code to show that EDA was performed?
* Does the machine learning model contain the following?
  * Preprocessing steps and feature selection
  * Data split into training and testing sets
* What are the limitations of the machine learning model?
* Does the database contain the following?
  * Integration with the project
  * At least two tables
  * An ERD relationship
  * A join and a connection string
* Does the storyboard describe the tools used and does it contain interactive elements?

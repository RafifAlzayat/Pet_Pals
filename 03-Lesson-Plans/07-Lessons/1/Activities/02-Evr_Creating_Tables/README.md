## Creating Tables

In this activity, you will use pgAdmin to recreate and query a table based on image provided to you.

### Instructions

1. Create a new database in pgAdmin named `city_info`.

2. Using the query tool, create an empty table named `cities`. Be sure to match the data types!

3. Insert data into the new table. The result should match the following image.

    ![cities_table.png](Images/cities_table.png)

4. Query the table to view the cities.

    ![cities_only.png](Images/cities_only.png)

5. Filter the table to view only cities in Texas.

6. Filter the table to view only cities with a population of less than 100,000.

7. Filter the table to view California cities with a population of less than 100,000.

8. Update the table to correct the state for the city of "Anaheim".  

9. Remove the duplicate entry of `('Boerne', 'Texas', 16056)` using the unique "id". 

### Hints

* For the second bonus question, you will need to use a [`WHERE` clause](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-where-clause.htm) to filter the original query.

* For the third bonus question, an [`AND` clause](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-and-or-clauses.htm) will also be necessary.

// Filter the top 15 cities with a population increase greater than 15,000
//  and then graph each city on the x-axis and the respective population on the y-axis.

// 1. Create a custom filtering function that returns
//  the cities with a population increase greater than 15,000.


// 2. Use filter() to pass the function as its argument


// Check to make sure you filtered your cities correctly
// HINT: console.log() is your friend.


// 3. Use the map method with the arrow function to return all the filtered cities' names.


//  Check your filtered cities


// 4. Use the map method with the arrow function to return all the filtered cities' populations.


//  Check the populations of your filtered cities

// 5. Create your trace.


// 6. Create the data array for our plot


// 7. Define our plot layout


// 8. Plot the chart to a div tag with id "bar-plot"

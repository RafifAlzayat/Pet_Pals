# Instructions

* Use the `dow.sqlite` dataset provided to query for the stock and average of the open, high, low, and closing prices for all stock in the month of May sorted by stock name.

* Plot the results as a Pandas or Matplotlib Bar Chart. 

### Bonus

Calculate the high-low peak-to-peak (PTP) values for `IBM` stock after `2011-05-31`.

* Note: high-low PTP is calculated using `high_price` - `low_price`
* Use a DateTime.date object in the query filter
* Use a list comprehension or NumPy's ravel method to unpack the query's list of tuples into a list of PTP values.
* Use matplotlib to plot the PTP values as a boxplot

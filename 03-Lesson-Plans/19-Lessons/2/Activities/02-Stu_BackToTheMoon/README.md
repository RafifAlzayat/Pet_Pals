### Instructions:

* Upload the starter notebook to Google Colab and run the cells to recreate the moons dummy dataset.

* Create your Keras Sequential model and add **more than one** Dense hidden layer to create a deep learning model.

  * **Notes:**

  * Only your first Dense layer uses the *input_dim* parameter.

  * All of your hidden layers should use the "relu" activation function.

* Compile your model and train the deep learning model on at least 100 epochs.

* Evaluate the performance of your model by calculating the loss and predictive accuracy of the model on your test dataset.

* **Bonus:** If time permits, try recreating your deep learning model with a different set of hidden layers and neurons, and then evaluate the performance of your new model. Are you able to achieve 100% predictive accuracy?

# Brains!

In this activity, you'll calculate a regression line to predict head size vs. brain weight.

## Instructions

1. Start by creating a scatter plot of the data to visually find out if any linear trend exists.

2. Split the data into training and testing data by using the sklearn `train_test_split()` function.

3. Use the linear regression model of sklearn to fit the model to the training data.

4. Use the test data to make new predictions. Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) and the R-squared (R2) score for those predictions.

5. Use `model.score()` to calculate the R2 score for the test data.
